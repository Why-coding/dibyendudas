Welcome to my personal space! I am Dibyendu Das, a PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at George Mason University. My research interests lies in Robotics, Computer Vision, Deep Learning, and Artificial Intelligence. Currently, I am working as a Graduate Research Assistant in the <a href='https://cs.gmu.edu/~xiao/RobotiXX/lab.html'>RobotiXX Lab</a>, guided by <a href='https://cs.gmu.edu/~xiao/index.html'>Dr. Xuesu Xiao</a>. My recent project is focused on developing memory-based motion planning techniques for autonomous robots. 

My academic journey began with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology, graduating in April 2019. Following my graduation, I contributed as a senior software engineer at Samsung R&D Institute Bangladesh, where I honed my skills in software development and innovation.

Beyond my academic and professional pursuits, I am deeply passionate about drama and acting, activities that allow me to explore various narratives and emotions. Sports, including cricket and tennis, alongside participation in social activities, reflect my commitment to a balanced lifestyle. Traveling holds a special place in my life, offering opportunities to discover new places and engage with diverse cultures.
